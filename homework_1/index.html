        <p>I am a man that wears many hats.  Literally
            and figuratively. </p> 
        <p>My main interest growing up was playing sports; jock.    
            In college I double majored in Finance and Economics; Finance Guy. </p>
            <p>Shortly after graduating from college
            I reported for hot weather training in Hattiesburg, Mississippi to 
            prepare for a year long deployment to Iraq; veteran.</p>  
            <p>And maybe someday after much classroom work and practice 
            I will call myself a developer.   </p>
