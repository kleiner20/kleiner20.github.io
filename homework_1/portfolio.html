I am a man that wears many hats.  Literally
and figuratively.  My main interest growing up was playing sports; jock.    
In college I double majored in Finance and Economics from 
Winona State University; Finance Guy. Shortly after graduating from college
I reported for hot weather training to Hattiesburg, Mississippi to 
prepare for a year long deployment in Iraq; veteran.  And maybe someday after much classroom work and training 
I could call myself a developer.
